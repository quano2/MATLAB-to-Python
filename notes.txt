Talk about how indentations were done:
	-In the parser
	-In the lexer (hard)
	-In the code generation pretty much impossible
	-A mixture worked best:
		~Store the lines where the for loops begins and ends
		~hard to for ones which don't have end from grammar
			+told end statments to add indents
	-No switch statments in python so made my own!
	-matlab can do p = 'hello'+6 mine cant
	-hard to deal with 4:2:0
		~used arange and will ignore any after 3rd number of 1:2:3:4:...:n
